                        Phnom Penh was founded in 1434 to succeed Angkor Thom as the capital of the Khmer nation but was abandoned several times before being reestablished in 1865 by King Norodom. 
                        The city formerly functioned as a processing centre, with textiles, pharmaceuticals, machine manufacturing, and rice milling.

                        Oudong, also known as Udong, is one of the most popular day trips from the capital Phnom Penh, which is about 40km. The town is located in the north-western part of Kampong Speu Province in Cambodia. 
                        The city is located at the foot of Phnom Udong or Oudong Mountain, which is a popular attraction among the tourists for plenty of beautiful Buddhist stupas lining atop the mountain.
                        Both ends of the mountain contain these historical stupas, which also offer magnificent views of the Cambodian countryside. Oudong mountain is a recommended day trip option for people exploring Phnom Penh.
                        The town was captured by the Khmer Rouges in 1974 during the Cambodian civil war, which resulted in mass killings of locals by marching them out of the city, along with taking many to labour camps. They also severely destroyed the important temples and plundered them, killing monks.

                        With massive building projects emerging and sustained growth, Phnom Penh is becoming a trade hub for foreign investors, according to H.E. Men Sam An, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of National Assembly 
                        and Senate Relations and Inspection.Speaking in front of 42-Chinese business delegates during the Tianxia Chaoshang Economic Conference on 26 August, H.E. Men Sam An highlighted the success of Cambodia’s 
                        economy while also pointing out the capital investment opportunities.“Phnom Penh is growing and is turning to become a very attractive and vibrant trade hub with active business activities,” she said.
                        Indeed, this great potential supported by the continued investment in high-rise buildings, hotels, restaurants, as well as shopping malls. In addition, the city continues to attract more and more residential
                        construction projects, she added. Addressing the country’s political and economic stability, H.E. Men Sam An asked Chinese business leaders to invest in Cambodia especially in high-potential sectors such as 
                        real estate, financial services, agriculture, industry and tourism.
