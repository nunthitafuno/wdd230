                        First explored by Father Escalante, a Jesuit Priest, in 1776, Springville was originally settled 
                        by eight pioneer families in 1850. It was first called Hobble Creek by the early pioneers because 
                        their horses were often hobbled (by loosely tying their front feet together) and left along the 
                        stream to graze in the lush grass. If the horses wandered into the creek, the hobbles came off in 
                        the water. Thus, the settlement earned its original name. Later, as the town grew, the name was 
                        changed to Springville, but the canyon stream and golf course have retained the name of Hobble Creek.

                        Springville is located in one of the most beautiful regions of the nation-nestled in the foothills of 
                        The Wasatch Range of The Rocky Mountains, two miles east of Utah Lake and just 45 miles south of Salt 
                        Lake City. Lying astride the I-15 freeway that runs between Canada and Los Angeles, the City is ideally 
                        positioned with easy access to Interstate 80 running between San Francisco and New York for distribution 
                        of goods by road to the major markets in the West. All vehicular traffic that transports goods to the 
                        north, south, east and west funnels through the interstate hub near Springville’s strategically important 
                        freeway location.

                        With its strong connection to the arts, Springville is thriving community that has experienced steady 
                        growth over the past ten years. Its current population of 30,000 continues to increase with 4.6% annual 
                        growth. Utah Department of Transportation (UDOT) recently completed a new I-15 interchange on the north 
                        side of Springville and will begin a $90 million transportation project to widen SR-77 (400 South) and 
                        rebuild the I-15 interchange. This project will replace the existing interchange with a singlepoint urban 
                        interchange, construct a new bridge over the Union Pacific tracks at about 1500 West, reconstruct the 
                        existing bridge over the Union Pacific Railroad tracks at about 400 West, widen 400 South to five lanes 
                        from I-15 to US 89 (Springville Main Street) and add a southbound auxiliary lane to I-15 between SR-75 and 
                        SR-77. Completion of the project is expected to take place in 2010. Springville City is in a unique position 
                        with underdeveloped I-15 frontage, new transportation/utility service to the I-15 area and a growing 
                        population. Springville is ready to accommodate dynamic future expansion of its commercial, office, retail and 
                        industrial sectors along the City’s I-15 corridor.
