                        Phnom Penh was founded in 1434 to succeed Angkor Thom as the capital of the Khmer nation but was abandoned several times before being reestablished in 1865 by King Norodom. 
                        The city formerly functioned as a processing centre, with textiles, pharmaceuticals, machine manufacturing, and rice milling.

                        Oudong, also known as Udong, is one of the most popular day trips from the capital Phnom Penh, which is about 40km. The town is located in the north-western part of Kampong Speu Province in Cambodia. 
                        The city is located at the foot of Phnom Udong or Oudong Mountain, which is a popular attraction among the tourists for plenty of beautiful Buddhist stupas lining atop the mountain.
                        Both ends of the mountain contain these historical stupas, which also offer magnificent views of the Cambodian countryside. Oudong mountain is a recommended day trip option for people exploring Phnom Penh.
                        The town was captured by the Khmer Rouges in 1974 during the Cambodian civil war, which resulted in mass killings of locals by marching them out of the city, along with taking many to labour camps. They also severely destroyed the important temples and plundered them, killing monks.

                        With its strong connection to the arts, Springville is thriving community that has experienced steady 
                        growth over the past ten years. Its current population of 30,000 continues to increase with 4.6% annual 
                        growth. Utah Department of Transportation (UDOT) recently completed a new I-15 interchange on the north 
                        side of Springville and will begin a $90 million transportation project to widen SR-77 (400 South) and 
                        rebuild the I-15 interchange. This project will replace the existing interchange with a singlepoint urban 
                        interchange, construct a new bridge over the Union Pacific tracks at about 1500 West, reconstruct the 
                        existing bridge over the Union Pacific Railroad tracks at about 400 West, widen 400 South to five lanes 
                        from I-15 to US 89 (Springville Main Street) and add a southbound auxiliary lane to I-15 between SR-75 and 
                        SR-77. Completion of the project is expected to take place in 2010. Springville City is in a unique position 
                        with underdeveloped I-15 frontage, new transportation/utility service to the I-15 area and a growing 
                        population. Springville is ready to accommodate dynamic future expansion of its commercial, office, retail and 
                        industrial sectors along the Cityâ€™s I-15 corridor.
