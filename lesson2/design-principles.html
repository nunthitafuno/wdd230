                </form>
                <p>The principle of repetition is shown in an example of a logo and text. For example, there is a repetition use in colors such as, yellow and white that go well together on the text and logo on top of the page which makes the page look appealing. This repetition also brings a cohesive relationship between element on the page and provide a sense of belonging and enhances the user experience.</p>
