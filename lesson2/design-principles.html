                <p>apple<br> <p>
                <a target="_blank" href="https://www.apple.com/apple-watch-series-7/">apple.com</a></p>
                <form>
                    <img src="images/applewatch.jpg" alt="mobile screenshot of apply site website">
                </form>
                <p>This apple advertisement has a clean design. For example, The space between text and element on this page makes the apple product stand out.

                <h3>Alignment</h3>
                <p><span>apple</span></p>
                <p><a target="_blank" href="https://www.apple.com/iphone/">apple.com</a></p>
                <form>
                    <img src="images/applemutiplelogo.jpg" alt="mobile screenshot of logo present in apple site">
                </form>
                <p>The principle of alignment is represented on each of the 6 apple services logos that are aligned in the center. This alignment makes the page look nice and more organized. The center alignment of the logo also draws the user's eye directly reading to the content, which enhances the user experience. All in all, alignment is one of the most important parts of design principles that it needs in a web page to make the web page appealing.</p>

This repetition also brings a cohesive relationship between element on the page and provide a sense of belonging and enhances the user experience.</p>
